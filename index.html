<h1><u>This Book Does Not Exist 2</u></h1>
<p>This Book Does Not Exist 2 is a redone version of <a href="">This Book Does Not Exist</a>. It utilises Generative Adversial Neural Networks to create new book covers.</p>

  <h3>Generative Adversial Network</h3>
  <p>A Generative Adversial Network or GAN for short is a type of AI that uses unsupervised learning to generate images.<br>Essentially, a GAN has two different AI both trying to outsmart the other, the generator and the discriminator.<br>The generator looks at input images, which in this case were book covers, and tries to create similar images.<br>The discriminator looks at these images and makes an assessment as to whether the images the generator made are real or fake.<br>If the discriminator classifies it as fake, the generator learns and tries again, making better results each time it tries.<br>Eventually, it gets to a point where the generator creates an image the discriminator classifies as real.</p>
